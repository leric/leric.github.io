	<h2>Hi, I'm {AUTHOR.name}</h2>

	<p>
		I'm a software architect passionate about exploring how AI and human expertise can work together to build better software systems. Through this blog, I share insights on software engineering, AI-powered development, and building maintainable systems through proper architecture and design.
	</p>

	<h2>What I Write About</h2>

	<p>
		My writing focuses on the intersection of AI and software engineering, particularly:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>AI-Powered Development:</strong> How AI coding tools can enhance (not replace) software engineering workflows</li>
		<li><strong>Software Architecture:</strong> Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, and SOLID principles in the AI era</li>
		<li><strong>Context Management:</strong> Managing complexity for both humans and AI agents</li>
		<li><strong>Architecture-Aware AI Agents:</strong> Designing AI collaborators that maintain system coherence</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>My Philosophy</h2>

	<p>
		I believe that the smartest people solve complex problems in the simplest way. As AI tools become more powerful, the need for solid architectural foundations and design principles becomes even more critical. My goal is to help developers navigate this new landscape by applying timeless software engineering practices in innovative ways.
	</p>
